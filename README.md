# E-commerce Back End 

## Description

I am very pleased to present this completed project. With the use of Object Relational Mapping, we were able to update the interaction between the database and server. In order to do this we used various dependencies like MySQL and Sequelize to set up routes and models to optimize the back end of the site. The main motivation behind this project was to help an ecommerce business manage their inventory.

## Installation

Installation is quite simple. First the user must clone this repo on their local device. From there download the needed dependencies by running 'npm install' in the root directory of the project.

## Usage

From the root directory, the user will run 'npm start' to initiate the server. From there the user can now add, update, remove, or view information within the database. To streamline this process, I reccommend using Insomnia (as shown in the walkthrough video).
